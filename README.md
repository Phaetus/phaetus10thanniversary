- Printer: Any 

- Filaments: Any (color prints are better)

- Infill: ≥10%

- Support: Off

- Model size: It is recommended not to be smaller than the original volume

- Print instructions: For conventional printing, adding support will affect the surface quality. In order to ensure the printing effect, the original Dr.ae model is divided into 5 parts: front head, back head, body, legs, and connecting parts. Two parts are connected by a cylinder, so that it can rotate, increase the mobility of the model, and make fun.
The infill density is recommended more than 10%. All parts are with the same infill density. 
All parts do not use the support when printing. When placing the model, the largest plane faces the hot bed. When printing the body, the neck part faces the hot bed.
After printing, connect all parts together. The unit of the model is millimeter.
When the model imports some slicer application, the model may appear abnormal. You can use the repair model option to repair the model.
